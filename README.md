This is coursework done as a student at the Tech Academy in Portland, OR.  

It is separated from the other coursework because it runs on a virtual
  Windows environment with different git permissions. 
  
  Like most languages you start with a simple Hello World - and then progress to a Pizza website.  So of course, I did another kitty-themed version.  (Rest assured, I am not a crazy cat lady!)
